## 3. Conflict Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Issue

* Clearly define the **problem or disagreement**.
* Focus on **facts and impact**, not personalities.

### Step 2: Communicate Privately

* Discuss the issue **one-on-one or in small groups**.
* Aim to **understand the other party’s perspective**.

### Step 3: Seek Mediation

* If private discussion fails, **involve the Lead or Vice Lead**.
* Lead may **act as a mediator** to propose solutions.

### Step 4: Document the Resolution

* Record the **problem, discussion points, agreed resolution, and next steps**.
* Share documentation with relevant ExCom members.

### Step 5: Follow-Up

* Check after a reasonable period to ensure the **resolution is effective**.
* Adjust the approach if needed.

## 4. Escalation Policy

1. **Minor Issues** → Handled by role-specific lead.
2. **Persistent / Major Conflicts** → Escalate to Lead.
3. **Unresolvable Conflicts** → Mentor (previous Lead) may provide advice, but final authority rests with current Lead.

> ⚠️ The Mentor is **advisory only**; they **cannot enforce decisions**.

---

## 5. Contributor / Student Conflicts

* Conflicts involving contributors or students should be **handled by Outreach Lead** first.
* If unresolved, escalate to **Lead**.
* Document all communications and actions.

---

## 6. Preventive Measures

1. **Clear Roles & Responsibilities**

   * Follow documented ExCom roles to **avoid overlapping authority**.

2. **Open Communication Channels**

   * Maintain **regular meetings and updates**.
   * Encourage contributors to voice concerns **early**.

3. **Respect Policies**

   * Always follow **Privacy Policy, Legal Guidelines, and Decision-Making process**.
