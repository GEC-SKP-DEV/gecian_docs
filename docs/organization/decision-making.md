# 🧭 Decision-Making Guidelines — Gecian Hub

## Purpose

This document explains **how decisions are made** within the Gecian Hub Executive Committee (ExCom).
It ensures clarity, responsibility, and accountability across all roles.

---

## 1. General Principles

1. **Responsibility follows Role**

   * Each role is responsible for decisions in their area of expertise.
   * Lead has final responsibility for all decisions.

2. **Consensus First, Authority Later**

   * Whenever possible, decisions should be **discussed and agreed upon collectively**.
   * If consensus cannot be reached, the **Lead makes the final decision**.

3. **Documentation is Key**

   * All important decisions should be **recorded in a shared document or issue tracker**.
   * Decisions include rationale, participants, and expected outcomes.

4. **Transparency**

   * Decisions impacting students, contributors, or project direction should be **communicated clearly** to relevant stakeholders.

## 3. Decision-Making Process

### Step 1: Identify the Decision

* Define **what needs to be decided**, urgency, and potential impact.

### Step 2: Gather Input

* Relevant ExCom members provide input based on their roles.
* Discuss **alternatives, pros/cons, and constraints**.

### Step 3: Propose a Solution

* Lead or responsible role proposes a **recommended course of action**.

### Step 4: Reach Consensus

* Attempt to **agree collectively** on the solution.
* Document **any concerns or dissenting opinions**.

### Step 5: Final Decision

* If consensus is reached → **decision is implemented**.
* If not → **Lead makes the final call**, explaining reasoning to the team.

---

## 4. Escalation Policy

* **Operational Conflicts:** Escalate to Lead or Vice Lead.
* **Technical Conflicts:** Escalate to Tech Lead, then Lead if unresolved.
* **Design Conflicts:** Escalate to Design Lead, then Lead if unresolved.
* **Community/Outreach Conflicts:** Escalate to Outreach Lead, then Lead.

> In emergencies, the **Lead can make unilateral decisions**, but must inform the team afterward.

---

## 5. Voting & Tie-Breaking

* Decisions that require multiple approvals may be **voted on by ExCom members**.
* **Lead has tie-breaking authority**.

---

## 6. Documentation & Communication

1. Record all decisions in **shared ExCom docs or GitHub issues**.
2. Note the **decision, date, participants, and rationale**.
3. Communicate decisions affecting contributors, users, or external parties.
4. Revisit decisions if outcomes differ from expectations or new information arises.

---

## 7. Review

* ExCom should **review key decisions quarterly** to ensure alignment with:

  * Project goals
  * Student needs
  * Legal and privacy compliance
