### Using Hacktoberfest for Contributions

**Hacktoberfest** is a program where we can tag our repositories as **Hacktoberfest-ready**. This helps us get **many free and genuine contributions** from the open-source community.

This is also a **great opportunity for the executive/core team** to:

* Learn how to use **GitHub PRs**
* Review and **merge pull requests**
* Understand basic **open-source workflows**

Since contributors are already motivated, it often results in **easy and quick PRs**.

If you know of **other similar programs**, we can also **enroll the organization** in them to receive more contributions.

⚠️ **Important Note:**
Because this is a **college website**, this approach should be used **only if student contributions are low or inactive**. It is a backup strategy, not the primary one.
