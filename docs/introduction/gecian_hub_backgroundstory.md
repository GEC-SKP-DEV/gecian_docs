# 👋 Who Am I?

My name is **Shadil**.
I am a **B.Tech student at Government Engineering College, Palakkad (GEC SKP)**.

Unlike many people you might see in tech communities, I don’t consider myself a particularly talented person. I also feel that I **did not fully utilize many of the opportunities** that were given to me.

For example, if I had made better use of the guidance and time I had with my seniors, I might have grown to a completely different level. This documentation—and this project—comes from that realization.

I am not writing this as a success story, but as an honest one.

# 🌱 How It Started

**Gecian Hub did not start as a main project.**

The very first idea was a repository called **Gecian Archive**.

Around **2024–2025**, I asked some of my seniors—**Vishnu Sunil** and **Rithin V**, who were also my hostel mates—to review my work. During those conversations, an idea came up:

> *If there was a place where seniors could showcase their projects, juniors could get inspired and build something more meaningful instead of just completing a mandatory mini project.*

This mattered because:

* Mini projects may be easier for some branches like **CSE**
* But for branches like **EEE**, building meaningful projects is much harder without guidance

With that idea, we started building **Gecian Archive** as a simple platform to showcase student projects.

At the same time, the FOSS Club also built a similar platform. There was no conflict—I simply shared that I was working on this as well.

## Not Just for One College

As the project evolved, it became clear that **Gecian Archive and related repositories were not official GEC platforms**.

They were created under an **open-source GitHub organization** called **CodeCompass**, which I later forked and adapted to suit a college ecosystem.

Since GEC is a **government institution**, using any platform officially would require multiple permissions. My teachers and HOD clearly told me that official adoption would not be possible—and that was completely understandable.

I don’t hate the college for this.
I don’t love it either.

I simply **don’t take it personally**.

# ❓ Why It Started

If someone asks me in one word how I feel about college, my answer would be: **neutral**.

I was never deeply involved in college activities.
I spent more time in my **hostel** than in college itself.

The idea behind Gecian Hub was never to fight the system or replace anything.
It was born because:

* There was **no internal way for departments to collaborate**
* There was **no central place for student-built tools**
* Existing official apps focused on administration, not student creativity

Over time, multiple ideas came together:

* Gecian Archive
* Gecian Collaboration
* Hostel-related tools

Eventually, these ideas merged into what is now called **Gecian Hub**.

As of now, Gecian Hub jut offical realsed it is not widley adopted yet 

That number may or may not grow—and that’s okay.

I am leaving this project to others, and I genuinely hope it succeeds even without me.

# 🤝 Giving Credit Where It’s Due

I want to clearly state something important.

The following projects:

* **Gecian Archive**
* **Gecian Collaboration**
* **GEC Hostel-related projects**

were **originally built by Soorja Krishna**.

Later, **me, Abhiram, and Abhijith** added support and improvements to these projects.
They were built inside the **CodeCompass** organization and later forked as needed.

My role was:

* Building on top of what already existed
* Giving ideas
* Connecting people
* Structuring things for the community

**Gecian Hub**, however, was built with collaboration from students of **batch 2022–2026**, along with a few contributors from **2024–2028**.

**Special Thanks** to Nirjan r , sreehari , Ashin t , hursh g 

I am not a special person.
I just wanted to give back to my fellow students **the same kind of guidance and inspiration my seniors once gave me**.
