## 🔁 **Project Continuity & Succession Failure Protocol**

### **Purpose**

This document defines the process to **ensure continuity of the project** in the event that leadership succession fails, becomes inactive, or the project setup is disrupted.
The goal is to ensure that the project **does not die due to mismanagement, negligence, or loss of access**, and can continue to benefit students.

---

## 🚨 **When This Protocol Applies**

This protocol applies if **any of the following occur**:

* The leadership succession is **broken or abandoned**
* The project becomes **inactive without formal handover**
* Access to repositories, hosting, or documentation is lost
* The existing team becomes **unresponsive or non-functional**
* The project is at risk of being discontinued despite student interest

---

## 🔄 **Right to Restart the Project**

If you are genuinely interested in continuing this project **within your own college** and the succession has failed:

* You are allowed to **restart and relaunch the project independently**
* The objective must remain aligned with the **original mission: helping students**
* The restart should be done **responsibly, transparently, and ethically**

This is **not a fork for personal gain**, but a continuity effort for community benefit.

---

## 👤 **Original Project Contact (Strongly Recommended)**

Before restarting, you should **attempt to contact the original initiator**:

* **Name:** Shadil AM
* **Role:** Original Creator / Initiator
* **Preferred Contact:** LinkedIn

If reachable:

* Coordinate to understand the original vision
* Request guidance, context, or approvals if necessary

---

## ❗ If Contact Is Not Possible

If the original initiator **cannot be reached**:

* The existing project setup or team **may provide access** to:

  * Source code
  * Configuration
  * Documentation
* You may proceed **in good faith** to relaunch the project

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Restart Guidelines**

* Use the provided or recovered **codebase**
* Host the project responsibly (e.g., **Netlify** or equivalent)
* Ensure:

  * Clean deployment
  * Secure configurations
  * Proper environment variables
* Maintain documentation from day one

---

## ⚠️ **Important Warnings**

* **Do not repeat mistakes of previous leadership**
* Avoid:

  * Poor documentation
  * Lack of accountability
  * Inactive ownership
* This project is **not casual or experimental**
* It carries **responsibility toward current and future students**

---

## 🤝 **Commitment Expectation**

Anyone restarting the project must commit to:

* Long-term maintenance
* Ethical and responsible usage
* Respect for community values
* Transparency in leadership and decision-making

This project exists to **serve students**, not individual recognition.

---

## 🧭 **Final Note**

The intent of this protocol is simple:

> **This project must continue, evolve, and help many others — regardless of leadership failure.**

If you choose to take responsibility, do it seriously, do it correctly, and do not abandon it halfway.
