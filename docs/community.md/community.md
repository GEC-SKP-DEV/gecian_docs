# Community Guidelines – Gecian Hub

Welcome to the **Gecian Hub community** 👋  
This document outlines how we work together and what we expect from everyone participating in our GitHub organization.

Gecian Hub exists to help students learn, collaborate, and grow through open source.  
To make that possible, we value **respect, learning, and transparency** over perfection.

---

## 🌱 Our Core Values

### 1. Learning Over Ego
No one here is expected to know everything.
- Beginners are welcome
- Questions are encouraged
- Mistakes are part of learning

There is no place for superiority or gatekeeping.

---

### 2. Respect for Everyone
We respect all contributors regardless of:
- Branch or department
- Experience level
- Background or opinions

Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks will **not** be tolerated.

---

### 3. Transparency & Honesty
- Decisions should be explained clearly
- Credits should be given fairly
- If something doesn’t work, we talk about it openly

---

### 4. Community Before Code
Code matters — but people matter more.

We prioritize:
- Healthy collaboration
- Constructive feedback
- Long-term sustainability

---

## 🤝 Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to:

- Be polite and respectful in discussions

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

The following will **not** be accepted:

## 🛠 Maintainers & Decision Making

Final decisions rest with maintainers, but:
- Feedback is always welcome
- Discussions are encouraged
