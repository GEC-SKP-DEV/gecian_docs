## First-Year Student Onboarding Plan

### 1. During Admission Time

* When **first-year students arrive for admission**, our team or volunteers can be present at the **entrance**.
* Politely inform them:

  * If they want to know more about the college website and services
  * They can **visit the website**
  * They can also **install it as an app**
* Keep the explanation **short and friendly**.

---

### 2. After Admissions Are Completed

* During the **first or second week**, conduct an **orientation session**:

  * **Offline class** (preferred, if possible)
  * **Online class** if offline is not possible
* In this session:

  * Explain the **entire app**
  * Show how to **use key features**
  * Explain **how to install the app**

---

### 3. Target Audience

* The **main focus should be first-year students**.
* Most features of the app are **especially useful for first years**, so they should be the **priority audience**.
